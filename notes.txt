add_neurons!(c::Component, labels::Vector{String}) 
# or should this match how neurons are accessed to reduce confusion? i.e. labels::Vector{Tuple{String}}
# i guess i can just have both:
add_neurons!(c::Component, labels::Vector{Tuple{String}})
the latter will just call the former


# eventually support removing things (neurons, components, inputs, outputs)

# component default parameters

# how should parameter logging work? maybe provide a wrapper over DiffEqu's logged data to add labels?
get_data(result::ODEResult???, )
